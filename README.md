# Insurance-Analysis-PowerBI

Project Overview


This project is focused on building an interactive Insurance Data Analysis Dashboard using Power BI. The dataset used in this project includes key variables related to insurance costs such as age, sex, BMI, smoker/non-smoker status, region, and charges. By leveraging Power BIâ€™s capabilities, the project demonstrates how these factors influence insurance charges and helps uncover trends and insights.

Through the use of visualizations, data modeling, and interactive features, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, empowering users to explore relationships between factors like BMI, smoking habits, and regional differences, and how they affect insurance costs.



Dataset Description
The dataset initially contains the following columns:

Age: The age of the insured individuals.

Sex: The gender of the individuals.

BMI: Body Mass Index, indicating the individual's health based on weight and height.

Smoker/Non-Smoker: A binary field indicating if the individual is a smoker.

Region: The geographic region of the individual.

Charges: The medical charges billed to the individual by the insurance company.


Key Features

1) Data Acquisition and Cleaning: Import the insurance dataset into Power BI and clean the data using Power Query, preparing it for further analysis by handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.

2) Data Modeling: Establish relationships within the data and create calculated columns and DAX measures to derive key insights, such as average insurance charges by smoker status, BMI, or region.

3) Compelling Visualizations: Use Power BI's visualization tools to build dynamic and interactive charts that highlight relationships within the data. Examples include:
Scatter plots showing the correlation between BMI and insurance charges.
Bar charts comparing insurance charges across different regions and age groups.

4) Interactive Dashboards: Create dashboards with filters, slicers, and cross-filtering options that allow users to explore the data interactively, enabling deeper insights into factors influencing insurance premiums.

5) Advanced Insights: Utilize features like drill-through and cross-highlighting to dive deeper into specific data segments, such as exploring how smoking habits affect insurance charges or identifying regional differences in premiums.


Conclusion

This project delivers an end-to-end insurance data analysis solution using Power BI. By transforming raw insurance data into an interactive dashboard, it allows users to gain insights into the key factors driving insurance charges, such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. The result is a powerful tool for decision-making in the insurance sector, demonstrating the effectiveness of Power BI in real-world data analysis scenarios.
